This code implements a heap sort visualization in HTML and JavaScript.
It takes an input array, builds a binary tree representation, and converts it into a max heap. Then, it performs the heap sort algorithm, visualizing each step by highlighting and sorting the nodes.
Finally, it displays the sorted array and applies animation effects. 
The code dynamically updates the HTML elements to create an interactive and user-friendly visualization of the heap sort process.

To run this code:

1. Copy the provided HTML code into a new HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Enter an array of numbers in the input field, separated by spaces.
4. Click the "Sort" button.
5. Observe the binary tree visualization and the animation of the heap sort process.
6. Once the sorting is complete, the sorted array will be displayed below the visualization.
7. You can repeat the process by entering a new array and clicking the "Sort" button again.
